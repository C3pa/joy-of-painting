# The Painter
A mod that allows you to create paintings which can be sold or displayed in frames

## Painting Mechanic
- Painting quality determined by skill
- Place down an easel, add canvas
- Adjust camera to look at what you want to paint
- Camera moves to easel location, lets you look around, zoom in/out
- Painting materialises onto canvas (using method described here: https://discord.com/channels/210394599246659585/766432467162497065/967851368406732860)
- Check Sveng's photo mod to see how to capture screenshots
- Use shader to create painted effect: apply shader, grab screenshot, remove shader
- Other active shaders can affect the final painting, such as Skoomaesthesia
- Final painting is a rolled up canvas
